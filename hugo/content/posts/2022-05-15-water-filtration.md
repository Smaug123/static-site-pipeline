title: The water filtration industry has played us for absolute fools

I wanted to know whether my Brita water filter ("MAXTRA") actually purifies water.
The manufacturer [advertises](https://www.brita.co.uk/water-filter-system/water-filter-jugs#to-filtration) it as:

1. removing large particles;
2. removing metals via ion exchange;
3. removing chemicals like chlorine.

So I took a fresh cartridge, rinsed it with water following its directions, and put it through two filtration cycles of plain water.
Then I emptied the jug, made one mug of strong cherry-flavoured squash, and poured the squash into the filter jug.

I defy you to tell the difference between the following three pictures, which are the result of the first, second, and third successive filter runs respectively.

The real mug was me all along!
