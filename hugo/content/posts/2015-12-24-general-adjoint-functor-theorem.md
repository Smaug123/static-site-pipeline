title: General Adjoint Functor Theorem
---

Just a post to draw attention to [my new article][article] about the [General Adjoint Functor Theorem][GAFT].
It's a motivation of the GAFT and its proof.
I've never seen it motivated in this way, and it's actually quite a natural theorem.
I haven't managed to motivate the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem at all, although I'm told that it's natural if you know Stone-Cech compactification.
