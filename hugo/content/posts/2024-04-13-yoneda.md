# What is a diagram?

A functor \\(\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}\\) is basically a way of identifying a copy of \\(\mathcal{C}\\) inside \\(\mathcal{D}\\).
That is, it's a specification of an object of \\(\mathcal{D}\\) for every object of \\(\mathcal{C}\\), and corresponding morphisms inside \\(\mathcal{D}\\) which must go between the right objects for this to be a copy of \\(\mathcal{C}\\).

If we specialise to the category of sets, a functor \\(\mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{\mathbf{Set}}\\) is a set for every object of \\(\mathcal{C}\\), and functions between those objects.

Imagine \\(\mathcal{C}\\) as some kind of abstract template of a universe of types; then a functor \\(\mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{\mathbf{Set}}\\) is an *instantation* of that universe of types.
For example, perhaps we decide that this particular object of \\(\mathcal{C}\\) will be instantiated to \\(\mathbb{N}\\), and that particular object will be instantiated to \\(\mathrm{Bool}\\), and this arrow between them will be instantiated to \\(n \mapsto \mathrm{isEven}(n)\\).

Recall what the functor laws in this context are:

* The functor respects endpoints of morphisms: if \\(f: A \to B\\) in \\(\mathcal{C}\\), then \\(Ff : FA \to FB\\) in \\(\mathrm{\mathbf{Set}}\\). That is, we really are identifying a copy of \\(\mathcal{C}\\) in \\(\mathrm{\mathbf{Set}}\\): we're not actively breaking the structure in translation. If the template \\(\mathcal{C}\\) tells us how to get from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), then we can do that in our instantiation.
* The identity morphism is always taken to the identity function. (This one's fairly self-explanatory.)
* The functor respects compositions: \\(F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)\\). That is, if the template tells us we can do \\(f\\) then \\(g\\), we can also do that in our instantiation; moreover, if our template tells us two paths are equal, then they're also equal in the instantiation.

Note what we're *not* requiring of our instantiations: that they're somehow "fully preserving all the structure".
If \\(\mathcal{C}\\) has two objects \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we're perfectly happy to instantiate both of them to the same type, as long as all the arrows keep composing correctly.
In particular, every category has a trivial instantiation to the universe where there's only one set \\(\emptyset\\), and only one arrow \\(\mathrm{id} : \emptyset \to \emptyset\\).

# Homomorphisms between diagrams

Thinking of a diagram as some kind of instantiation of an abstract template, we can define homomorphisms (that is, structure-preserving maps) between them.
The concrete example of the "trivial instantiation" in the previous section may help you imagine how these homomorphisms should work.

If we have two diagrams \\(F, G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{\mathbf{Set}}\\), we can define some particular homomorphism \\(\alpha\\) from the \\(F\\)-instantiation to the \\(G\\)-instantiation by sending every concrete \\(F\\)-type to a corresponding concrete \\(G\\)-type.
In order to deserve the name "homomorphism", it had better preserve the structure: that is, if \\(x : FA \to FB\\) is a function in our concrete instantiation of \\(\mathcal{C}\\), then it had better be the case that our homomorphism \\(\alpha\\) takes \\(x\\) to a suitable corresponding function \\(GA \to GB\\) in the \\(G\\)-instantiation.

In fact, every function in the \\(F\\)-instantiation is an image of a morphism from \\(\mathcal{C}\\) (that is, we defined our instantiations so that we weren't considering any extraneous functions there might be between the sets), so instead of considering the set of all general \\(x : FA \to FB\\), we only need to consider the set of all \\(Ff : FA \to FB\\).
Similarly, the functions \\(GA \to GB\\) are all of the form \\(Gg : GA \to GB\\) for some morphism \\(g\\) of \\(\mathcal{C}\\).

That is, a homomorphism from diagram \\(F\\) to diagram \\(G\\) is:

* an assignment, for each \\(A : |\mathcal{C}|\\), of some \\(GX\\) corresponding to \\(FA\\);
* an assignment, for each \\(\mathcal{C}\\)-morphism \\(f : A \to B\\), of some \\(Gg\\) corresponding to \\(Ff\\);
* proofs that this all respects the structure: if \\(f : A \to B\\) in \\(\mathcal{C}\\), then the map \\(Ff : FA \to FB\\) gets taken to the map \\(Gf : GA \to GB\\).

So actually the homomorphism \\(\alpha\\) is pretty constrained: it must map \\(FA \mapsto GA\\) for each \\(A \in |\mathcal{C}|\\) (so there's no freedom about where the objects go).

We have a special name for these structure-preserving maps between diagrams: we call them *natural transformations*.
They provide us with a way of mapping between instantiations of the abstract theory specified by \\(\mathcal{C}\\).

# There are some very special examples of diagrams

We saw already that there are some pretty degenerate diagrams: the one which has every object going to the empty set, for instance.
That diagram has somehow "thrown away all the information" from the category.

Diagrams can also be pretty complex: for example, if we imagine the diagrams for the very simple category that contains just one element and one arrow, literally every set in the universe is a diagram for this category (together with the identity function on that set)!
Most of those diagrams involve us ignoring tons of structure.
For example, there are \\(\mathbb{R}\\)-many functions \\(\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\\), so we're having to ignore uncountably many functions in the category of sets if we take the diagram consisting of "\\(\mathbb{N}\\) and its sole identity function".
This diagram wants to have way more structure than there was in \\(\mathcal{C}\\), and it's only by shutting our eyes and ignoring the set-structure we don't care about that we recover anything that looks remotely like \\(\mathcal{C}\\)!

It turns out there's a sweet spot of diagrams with "exactly the amount of structure \\(\mathcal{C}\\) specified, and no more".
The construction is: assume there's only one element in \\(FA\\) (for some \\(A\\)), and then chase through everything else that \\(\mathcal{C}\\) says should exist (which may involve adding in more elements of \((FA\)) if there are morphisms telling us there should be more).

What does \\(\mathcal{C}\\) say should exist?
If \\(f : A \to B\\) is a morphism of \\(\mathcal{C}\\), and if \\(a \in FA\\) is an element of our concrete instantiation of the object \\(A\\), we really want there to be a distinct object \\((Ff)(a) \in FB\\) so that we've preserved the information "\\(f\\) was a morphism \\(A \to B\\)".
(If there weren't any such member of \\(FB\\), then our diagram has lost information: we might not be able to distinguish any more whether there was a morphism \\(f\\) in \\(\mathcal{C}\\) or not, just by looking at our instantiation \\(F\\).)

So if we assume there's an element \\(a \in FA\\), then for every \\(B \in |\mathcal{C}|\\), we can deduce the existence of elements \\((Ff)(a) \in B\\) for every \\(f : A \to B\\) in \\(\mathcal{C}\\); and they'd better all be distinct if we couldn't prove them to be equal in \\(\mathcal{C}\\).

Formally: for each object \\(A\\) of \\(\mathcal{C}\\), we can define a diagram \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A : \mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{\mathbf{Set}}\\) given by sending each \\(B\\) to the set of all morphisms in \\(\mathcal{C}\\) which go from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).
This somehow "captures exactly all the structure that \\(\mathcal{C}\\) said \\(A\\) has".
(I've used the symbol \\(\mathrm{Rep}\\) to denote these diagrams, because the category-theoretic term for a diagram isomorphic to one of these is "*representable functor*".)

Note that I haven't yet written down the functions in these concrete instantiations of \\(\mathcal{C}\\); there's only one thing it could plausibly be.
Given \\(f : B \to C\\) a morphism of \\(\mathcal{C}\\), the corresponding function \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A(f) : \mathrm{Rep}_A(B) \to \mathrm{Rep}_A(C)\\) (that is, the function \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A(f) : \langle\text{morphisms $A \to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$}\rangle \to \langle\text{morphisms $A \to C$ in $\mathcal{C}$}\rangle\\) is defined to be given by composing with \\(f\\): we send \\(g : A \to B\\) to \\(f \circ g : A \to C\\).

These particular diagrams, the *representable functors* (one for every object in \\(\mathcal{C}\\)), together tell you everything there is to know about the category.
(That is kind of intuitive, by their definition as "the sets of morphisms": we can list out every morphism in the category, just by writing down every element of every object in each of these concrete instantiations.)
What might be less intuitive and requires a bit more thinking is their characterisation as "define \\(F\\) by supposing there's some single member \\(a \in FA\\), and then seeing what else is forced to exist"; you might find it helps to write out a concrete example of performing this operation for some particular tiny categories.

# Homomorphisms of the representable functors

The representable functors contain so little structure that their homomorphisms are forced to be quite simple.

Given any diagram \\(G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{\mathbf{Set}}\\), and given any \\(A \in |\mathcal{C}|\\), we can precisely characterise the homomorphisms \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A \to G\\).
Remember, \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A\\) was defined by supposing there's just one "free generator" element \\(a \in \mathrm{Rep}_A(A)\\), and then throwing into every object all the other elements that are forced to exist by morphisms of \\(\mathcal{C}\\).
So intuitively speaking it should be the case that a homomorphism \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A \to G\\) is precisely defined by where that one element \\(a\\) is sent; once we've defined that, *everything* else in our instantiation \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A\\) should be forced by the "preserves morphism structure" property of homomorphisms.

This reasoning is made formal in the *Yoneda lemma*:

> Pick an arbitrary diagram \\(G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{\mathbf{Set}}\\). Then for every object \\(A : |\mathcal{C}|\\), the homomorphisms from the diagram \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A\\) to \\(G\\) are precisely in correspondence with the elements of \\(G(A)\\). Moreover, this correspondence is natural in both \\(A\\) and \\(G\\).

Intuition: the homomorphisms are precisely defined by what happens to the "free generator", and we can get such a homomorphism from any choice of where the "free generator" goes.
Moreover,
* this construction is respected by homomorphisms out of \\(G\\) (that's "naturality in \\(G\\)": if we have a homomorphism \\(h : G \to H\\), and we perform the construction on both \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), we find that every homomorphism \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A \xrightarrow{\text{Yoneda corresponding to $x \in GA$}} G \xrightarrow{h} H\\) is equal to \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A \xrightarrow{\text{Yoneda corresponding to $h(x) \in HA$}} H\\));
* this construction is respected by morphisms \\(A \to B\\) (that's "naturality in \\(A\\)"): this is currently entirely an exercise because I've ground to a halt.

The precise construction is as follows:

* Given an element \\(a \in G(A)\\), define a homomorphism \\(\mathrm{Rep}_A\\) to \\(G\\) by sending \\(f : A \to B\\) to \\((Gf)(a)\\).
* Given a homomorphism \\(\alpha : \mathrm{Rep}_A\\) to \\(G\\), define an element of \\(G(A)\\) by \\(\alpha(\mathrm{id}_A : A \to A)\\).
* Show that these are inverse to each other.
* Prove the naturality conditions.

Exercise: do those formally!
