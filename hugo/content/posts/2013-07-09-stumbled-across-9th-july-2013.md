Being bored over the summer holiday, I decided that I would document the cool things I ran across on the Internet. Over the last week, there have been many of these. If I see anything particularly amazing, it'll go in one of these aggregation posts.

*   Neurons are surprisingly beautiful: <http://blog.eyewire.org/gallery/image-gallery/>
*   A rather neat and very short story: <https://qntm.org/timeloop>
*   A *bit* less short but just as good a short story: <https://qntm.org/responsibility>
*   A rant with which students can all identify, in The Cambridge Student magazine: now lost from the Internet.
*   An Easter Island word "tingo" means "to borrow objects from a friend’s house one by one until there are none left": <link to the Internet Archive>("http://web.archive.org/web/20100516040410/http://blog.web-translations.com/2008/12/toujours-tingo-words-that-dont-exist-in-english/)
*   Musings on free will: <http://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/godTaoist.html>
*   A thing that I just have to share again: <http://nextbigfuture.com/2013/06/technical-hurdles-have-been-overcome.html>
*   The human brain is a really weird piece of kit: <http://lesswrong.com/lw/20/the_apologist_and_the_revolutionary/>
*   We *have* to make one of these at some point: <http://www.pimpthatsnack.com/project/302/1">
*   This is quite soothing in a weird kind of way: <https://thingsfittingperfectlyintothings.tumblr.com/>
*   It is possible to be deficient in arsenic. (Link to the Soylent Discourse forum is permanently defunct.)
*   A really useful website for when you don't want to have to spin up Wolfram|Alpha to work out time differences: <http://everytimezone.com/>
*   Why never to talk to the police (seriously, never talk to the police): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc>
*   A fascinating book about the power of positive and negative reinforcement, and why they're often done wrongly: [Don’t Shoot the Dog]
*   The Church of England really took its time, but at last they've done it: <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23215388>
*   The Hawkeye Initiative, for the liberation of women in comics: <http://thehawkeyeinitiative.com/>
