Being bored over the summer holiday, I decided that I would document the cool things I ran across on the Internet. Over the last week, there have been many of these. If I see anything particularly amazing, it'll go in one of these aggregation posts.

* [Neurons are surprisingly beautiful](http://blog.eyewire.org/gallery/image-gallery/)
* A rather neat and very short story, [Time Loop](https://qntm.org/timeloop) by qntm
* A bit less short but just as good a short story: [I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility](https://qntm.org/responsibility) by qntm
* A rant with which students can all identify, in The Cambridge Student magazine: now lost from the Internet.
* An Easter Island word "tingo" means "to borrow objects from a friend's house one by one until there are none left": [Link to the Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20100516040410/http://blog.web-translations.com/2008/12/toujours-tingo-words-that-dont-exist-in-english/)
* Musings on free will: [Is God a Taoist?](http://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/godTaoist.html)
* A thing that I just have to share again: [Technical hurdles have been overcome for the first human head transplant](http://nextbigfuture.com/2013/06/technical-hurdles-have-been-overcome.html)
* The human brain is a really weird piece of kit: [The Apologist and the Revolutionary](http://lesswrong.com/lw/20/the_apologist_and_the_revolutionary/)
* We *have* to make one of these at some point: [the Creme de la Creme Egg](https://www.pimpthatsnack.com/project/the-creme-de-la-creme-egg/)
* This is quite soothing in a weird kind of way: [Things Fitting Perfectly Into Things](https://thingsfittingperfectlyintothings.tumblr.com/)
* It is possible to be deficient in arsenic. (Link to the Soylent Discourse forum is permanently defunct.)
* A really useful website for when you don't want to have to spin up Wolfram|Alpha to work out time differences: [Every Time Zone](http://everytimezone.com/)
* Why never to talk to the police (seriously, never talk to the police): [Don't Talk to the Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc)
* A fascinating book about the power of positive and negative reinforcement, and why they're often done wrongly: [Don't Shoot the Dog](https://web.archive.org/web/20130206170903/http://www.papagalibg.com/FilesStore/karen_pryor_-_don_t_shoot_the_dog.pdf)
* The Church of England really took its time, but at last they've done it: [Church of England makes Chichester child abuse apology](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23215388)
