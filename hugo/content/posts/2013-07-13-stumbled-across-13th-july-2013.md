*   This is really quite heartwarming: <http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/>
*   Interesting article on current trends in fiction: <http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2013/01/david-brin-our-favorite-cliche-a-world-filled-with-idiots-orwhy-films-and-novels-routinely-depict-society-and-its-citizens-as-fools/>
*   A ridiculous reason for a rocket to explode: <https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/07/parts-installed-upside-down-caused-last-weeks-russian-rocket-to-explode/>
*   A very information-dense way of storing data long-term: <https://phys.org/news/2013-07-5d-optical-memory-glass-evidence.html> (compare <http://rosettaproject.org/disk/technology/> which is much less information-dense but much more easily decoded in the event of being discovered after the collapse of civilisation)
*   A cool thing to do with a Raspberry Pi and a microwave: <http://madebynathan.com/2013/07/10/raspberry-pi-powered-microwave/>
*   I really want one of these - I think I might order one: <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cloud-guys/plug-the-brain-of-your-devices> (also, the word "plug" is insanely wonderful when spoken in a French accent)
*   An interesting idea for making the world a better place: <http://web.archive.org/web/20130713135924/http://simulacrum.cc/2013/07/10/three-trends-that-push-us-towards-an-unconditional-basic-income/>
*   A look at how to infer causality or not, as the case may be, depending on the data: <http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/if-correlation-doesnt-imply-causation-then-what-does/>
*   I hope they get to producing this quickly: <http://technabob.com/blog/2013/05/22/lumigrids-bike-leds/>
*   Thank goodness for that - regular expressions are the most unreadable things ever: <https://phys.org/news/2013-07-ordinary-language.html>
*   Something else I would do if I had eternity to play with: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voB6WiP83NU>
*   Glass ceiling issues: <http://whatwouldkingleonidasdo.tumblr.com/post/54989171152/how-i-discovered-gender-discrimination>
