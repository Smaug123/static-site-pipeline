title: Rage, rage against the poet’s hardest sell
---
I feel that I can write a sonnet well.  
While sonnets are an easy thing to spout,  
It’s really hard to write a villanelle.

By rhyming, any story I can tell:  
in couplets, rhyme and rhythm evens out.  
I feel that I can write a sonnet well.

But alternately-structured verse is hell.  
The poet struggles, juggles words about:  
It’s really hard to write a villanelle.

Enthusiasm’s difficult to quell.  
An acolyte of Shakespeare, I’m devout:  
I feel that I can write a sonnet well.

But triplets are a task on which I dwell,  
I’m running out of rhymes, without a doubt.  
It’s really hard to write a villanelle.

For sonnets, you don’t have to be [Kal-El][1]  
to make a super stanza just work out.  
I feel that I can write a sonnet well;  
It’s really hard to write a villanelle.
