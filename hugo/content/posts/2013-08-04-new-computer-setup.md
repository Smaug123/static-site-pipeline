title: New computer setup
---

*Editor's note: this is a snapshot of life in 2013-08-04. My setup has changed substantially since then.*

In case I ever have to get a new computer (or, indeed, in case anyone else is interested), I hereby present the (updating) list of applications and so forth that I would immediately install to get a computer up to usability.

*   Browser: [Firefox] with [Ghostery], [HTTPS Everywhere], and [NoScript] (and remember to turn on Do Not Trackâ€¦)
*   Mail client: [Thunderbird] with [Enigmail]
*   Messaging client: [Adium] on Mac, and possibly [Pidgin] for others - I've never used a non-Mac chat client. Beware: as of this writing, Pidgin stores passwords in plain text, so don't save passwords in Pidgin.
*   Encryption: GPG ([Windows][GPG Windows], [Mac][GPG Mac], [Linux][GPG Linux])
*   Text editor: Vim
*   Memory training: [Anki]
*   Movie viewing: [VLC]
*   Screen colour muter: [f.lux]
*   Backup software: [CrashPlan] - but I also keep local backups using whatever built-in automated backup utility the OS provides
*   FTP client: [FileZilla], or [Cyberduck] on a Mac
*   Syncing: [Dropbox] (but I want to get rid of this, because of privacy concerns)
*   Computational software: [Mathematica]
*   Music: [iTunes] (but I want to switch this for something not-Apple, and it has no Linux version)
*   Gaming: [Steam]
*   RSS reader: Currently, my RSS feed is presented in-browser, at [NewsBlur].
