The generally accessible posts of which I am most proud on this website are:

* [Anki as Learning Superpower] (how to squeeze a bit more out of your Anki usage)
* [The Ravenous] (parody of [The Raven])
* [Thinking Styles] (about how people think differently to each other)
* [On Shakespeare] (the foolishness of teaching Shakespeare in school to pupils of a young age)

The mathematical posts:

* [Slightly Silly Sylow Pseudo-Sonnets][Sylow sonnets] (poetical proof of the Sylow Theorems)
* [General Adjoint Functor Theorem][GAFT] (exposition on the GAFT and how it is actually a very natural theorem)

The computer-science posts:

* [Defunctionalisation] (on an underappreciated method of writing software)
* [Continuation-passing style] (on motivating a technique in functional programming)
* [Rewriting the Technical Interview, in Mathematica] (digging into the internals of Mathematica's parser)
* [In praise of `--dry-run`][dryrun] (a technique for writing better tools)
* [Metatesting your property-based tests] (an easy technique to improve your property-based tests)
