The next few posts will be following me on my journey through the book [Category Theory], by Steve Awodey. I’m using the second edition, if anyone wants to join me. I will read the book and make notes here as I go along: doing the exercises (if they seem interesting enough, I’ll post them up here), coming up with my own intuition pumps, and generally writing down my thought processes. The idea is to see how a fledgling mathematician studies a text, and to record my thoughts so I can refresh my memory more easily in future.

As I go, I’m also creating an Anki deck of the definitions, by the way, although that might not appear on this site.
