    "\"\<I still remember the first time I ever visited the house. My friend \
Emmett - from the Jazz lounge where I played sometimes Friday nights - had \
lived there for years and invited me over for house dinner and to watch a \
movie with him. When I arrived, he gave me a tour through the maze of rooms \
and muralled hallways, even the treehouse out back with a drawbridge and a \
fire pole from the third floor to the first. Just about every room in the \
house (and there were a lot!) had a story attached to it, which made the tour \
both really interesting and really long. When we finally heard the shouts for \
dinnertime, I served myself the lentil curry, roasted brussels sprouts, and \
quinoa, and wandered toward the tables. \\\"Sit over here!\\\" a guy wearing \
an xkcd shirt called to me. I squeezed in beside him as he explained, \\\"we \
call this the inductive table. If it can fit n people, it can fit n+1.\\\" \
The conversation over the next half hour covered a Martian rover, raising \
chickens, and principal ideal domains...I kind of felt like I'd known these \
people my whole life. \\\"I wish I lived here,\\\" I said offhandedly as I \
gathered my empty plate to wash. \\\"You totally should!\\\" said xkcd-guy \
(whose name, it turned out, was Oliver). And I got to thinking. Much later, \
in the darkness of a starless night as I walked home, the idea of moving in \
seemed completely natural. I turned back to the house to see the rainbow \
\\\"you are welcome here\\\" sign (on which someone had scrawled \\\"straight \
people welcome on alternate Thursdays\\\") and the flower bed containing a \
pinwheel masquerading as a pansy. I was sold.\>\"", ",", 
     "\"\<The day I moved in, I was welcomed by a girl with lavender hair and \
a pocket protector who gave me the unofficial tour. She pointed at a whip on \
a hook by the door. \\\"That's in case of burglars and the like. Alice found \
it at Goodwill along with a pair of handcuffs and a leather thong after this \
sex dungeon went out of business.\\\" Next, she pointed at an alcove with a \
public computer. \\\"That's to look up directions or to check facts on \
Wikipedia if you get in an argument with someone and have to prove you're \
right.\\\" I was entranced by the fractal screensaver that kept drawing \
itself in exponentially multicolored smaller iterations until it was too \
small to detect, then zoom in and keep going. The girl followed my stare. \
\\\"Oh yeah, Ethan programmed the screensaver,\\\" she said, \\\"he could \
keep a genius occupied for hours with math questions.\\\" As she led me up \
the stairs, the wood floors creaked beneath our feet. \\\"It's an old house, \
but it's totally safe,\\\" she told me. She tilted her head to the side. \
\\\"I think,\\\" she added. \\\"And this is you!\\\" She dramatically opened \
the door to my new room, which was super-duper tiny, but there was this prism \
hung in the window and the late afternoon sun made shards of light dance \
around the room. I looked at the rainbow lights hopping across the wood floor \
and I was home. I moved the desk to the center of the room, directly below \
the skylight in the ceiling, so I would feel like a princess in a spotlight \
while doing psets, and plunked myself down on the chair. \\\"Seems like \
you're all good here,\\\" she said with a smile, and it was only as she \
turned to go that I noticed the tiny Rubik's cube earring in the loeb of her \
left ear. Definitely at home.\>\"", ",", "\[IndentingNewLine]", 
     "\"\<When Emmett and Savanah (also from the Jazz lounge) came to visit \
the next week, I took them on a tour of my own through the maze of staircases \
and rooms. \\\"This place is really cool,\\\" Savanah gushed, investigating \
our hallway murals. \\\"It has so much charact -\\\" she stopped short and \
stared open-mouthed at a guy dissecting an octopus and wearing exactly \
nothing. I tugged at her elbow and led her through our common room and \
towards our central staircase. \\\"That's Jacob,\\\" I explained. But I guess \
that wasn't much of an explanation because she still looked like she was in \
shock. \\\"He's course 7. He's doing his senior thesis on sea animals or \
something.\\\" Savanah looked at me like I was crazy. \\\"But he wasn't \
wearing anything!\\\" she exclaimed. \\\"Oh right. We're clothing-optional \
here.\\\" She stared at me. \\\"It's really great when you forget to bring \
your towel with you to the shower.\\\" Light from the skylight fell across \
her skeptical face. How was it that in just a week I'd come to feel like I'd \
lived here my whole life?\>\"", ",", 
     "\"\<Sleep deprivation being the drug of choice in my life at the time, \
it wasn't unusual for me to wake up disoriented with the imprint of my laptop \
keyboard on my cheek and late afternoon sunlight streaming in through the \
skylight above my desk. Such was my half-awake and dazed state the day I \
walked outside and saw the pirate ship in the backyard, like a beacon \
vertically aligned with the shed. I kind of blinked for a minute, because I \
swear the yard was empty that morning and now there was this sailboat in it, \
complete with a skull-and-crossbones flag. \\\"Ahoy matey!\\\" Oliver called \
to me as he took a running start, leapt into the boat, and struck a pose. \
\\\"Ahoy?\\\" I called back, a little confused by where this was going with \
no water. The compass he held in his hand glinted in the sun. \\\"What's a \
pirate's favorite mathematical field?\\\" he asked me. I stared at him. \
\\\"Arrrr!\\\" called Ethan as he hurdled himself from \
I'm-not-even-sure-where into the boat and gave Oliver a high five.\>\"", ",", 
     "\[IndentingNewLine]", 
     "\"\<By the end of the day, the boat, which Oliver had completely fixed \
up from an old crumbling dinghy, was ready for its big debut in open water. \
We got it loaded onto a makeshift cart-thingy and about a dozen of us walked \
it down to the river for moonlight sail. Ethan and Oliver eased it into the \
water and hopped on board, while the rest of us split into twos and threes \
and boarded other sailboats at the dock. Soon we were all out on the river, \
gliding peacefully through the crisp night air and gazing at Orion in the \
southeastern skies. That is, until Alice and Jacob slid in close to Ethan and \
Oliver and splashed them with a bucket of river water. Within minutes, all \
five of our boats were in a water war, each of us attempting to get close \
enough to another to throw water at one another and then sail quickly away. \
We were all relatively evenly matched and relatively evenly soaked until the \
pirate ship started pirating. Ryan and I watched it coming towards us and \
prepared our bucket for attack. But just as it got within feet of our boat, \
and before we could even lift the bucket, Ethan leapt off his vessel and \
landed beside me. He grabbed hold of the sail of our boat with each hand and \
leaned back with all his weight. Within moments I was in the river, coughing \
and spluttering and looking around for our capsized dinghy. It only took me a \
few seconds to locate it and swim towards it, and as I grabbed hold of the \
side and began trying to right it with Ryan's help, I saw a dripping wet \
Ethan grinning and waving at us beneath his black flag as he sailed away. My \
teeth were chattering when we all walked home together about an hour later, \
and I was desperately looking forward to the toastie warmth of home and a \
promised fire in the fireplace. The rainbow sign on the door could not have \
come soon enough. By the time I was dry and changed into fresh clothes, the \
fire was crackling and half a dozen people gathered around it singing. I \
joined in \\\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\\", warmed by the music of this cozy \
little group gathered in the darkness lit only by the twisting flames. \
\\\"Anyone want cookies?\\\" Amy asked as she came in from the kitchen with a \
heavenly smelling tray, and my evening was complete.\>\"", ",", 
     "\[IndentingNewLine]", 
     "\"\<Despite all the warm-fuzzies of the fireplace and singing and \
kumbaya and all that, Ethan was not off the hook. Oh no. I mean, it was all \
in good fun, and yeah it was a pretty badass move, but Ryan and I knew we had \
to plot a comeback. The idea came to me when Ryan sent out an email asking \
all the cooks to send him their menus, since he was in charge of the shopping \
(usually he tried to do his house job as early as possible in the week, but \
he'd been hosed.) See, I knew that while Ethan loved broccoli and cauliflower \
for their repetitive geometry, he hated tropical fruit. So I just suggested \
we replace at least one requested item from each day's menu with a tropical \
fruit as a little surprise. I figured the cooks would be totally down to \
experiment with how to incorporate an unexpected ingredient...and I happen to \
love papaya. By the time the last menu came in that evening, we only had \
about a half hour before the grocery store closed for the night and in the \
rush to go, I tripped over the flower bed outside the front door. By the time \
we had scooped the soil back in, we had twenty minutes left. We literally ran \
to the store, breathlessly grabbed a cart, and practically sailed through the \
maze of aisles, trying to find each one of the dozens of items listed, not \
always very helpfully (like seriously, somebody had written \\\"granola from \
a brand that's called nature something or maybe something nature and I think \
the package is red but it might be green\\\"). Anyway, by 10:59 our mission \
was accomplished: all weekly food had been bought plus two bags of fruit. The \
next day, Priya looked at the twenty mangoes we had bought her instead of her \
requested bell peppers, read the note we had enclosed with it, and laughed. \
We all enjoyed the mango pilaf that night...except Ethan. But the best part \
was the look on his face when he tried the dragon fruit pudding (and the rush \
he was in to rinse his mouth after he spit it out). Priceless.\>\"", ",", 
     "\[IndentingNewLine]", 
     "\"\<Ethan prepared his response that night. He crept out to the back \
yard in the darkness with a pineapple in tow. He had decorated it to look \
like a face with wild carrot-spirals for hair and a superman cape. He placed \
his artwork at the end of the bow with a sign that said, \\\"I may not be \
delicious but I am the captain of the pirate ship and I contain the Fibonacci \
sequence. Mwahahaha.\\\"\>\"", ",", "\[IndentingNewLine]", 
     "\"\<I noticed Captain Pineapple the following morning as I went out for \
a run. Several of my housemates were already outside doing pushups and \
sweating profusely. \\\"We're doing the Murph,\\\" Amanda gasped as she \
rested for a moment. \\\"It's a CrossFit workout...next exercise is 300 \
squats; want to join?\\\" she asked, with a can-do attitude. I watched Carlos \
collapse into the grass and roll onto his back. \\\"I'm good,\\\" I said and \
took off toward the Esplanade. The rush of blood felt good throughout my body \
after a long week of psets and the early morning world seemed exceptionally \
alive. I watched the T glide across the Longfellow bridge like a caterpillar \
on ice skates and thought about all the people inside going places, thinking \
thoughts, experiencing experiences...it just kind of suddenly felt like I was \
this simultaneously insignificant and all-consuming being, like everything I \
did and said was the entirety of my own life but it was all a speck of dust \
in the world at large. I gazed at the sparkling river in the morning sunlight \
that just days ago I had fallen into in the darkness of night, and I planned \
my next move. As soon as I got home, I went to the fridge and took out all \
the dragon fruit left over from the pudding. I cut it up and arranged the \
pieces on the seat of the boat, forming the word, \\\"truce?\\\"\>\"", ",", 
     "\[IndentingNewLine]", 
     "\"\<After that, the pirate ship moved to the shed. In the years to \
follow, it would go on many more journeys, but this is the tale we still tell \
first to curious visitors. I had a professor that semester that always used \
to say, \\\"this isn't fun-and-games topology; this is point-set \
topology!\\\" And I guess I could say the same thing about that house. I mean \
sure, it was fun, and sure there were games, but it wasn't just fun-and-games \
coop life, and over time I would discover layers of depth in this group of \
people that I hadn't noticed on first meeting. My housemates were the compass \
that got me through each day that year. And sure, it was kind of annoying to \
find that the Coke someone had left open on the side counter was still there \
and still open 10 days later. And then to discover a lightened ring in the \
wood of the countertop 14 days after that, and the Coke still there and still \
open. And then to discover 9 days after that that was an intentional \
experiment, not to see if it would grow mold (which it did!) but to see if \
someone would take the initiative to throw it away (which obviously no one \
did, but honestly we were just trying to be respectful of someone else's \
drink/experiment!). And yeah, it's kind of fun to take a break at 3am from my \
automorphic forms project and hear someone tell the story of the superman \
Fibonacci fruit (and have someone else argue that it wasn't superman \
Fibonacci fruit, it was electric bluegaloo Fibonacci fruit). But it wasn't \
just about the games and it wasn't just about the pranks. It was about living \
a life worth living with people worth living it with. And peace and love and \
all that hippie stuff. So yeah, that's my story. The end.\>\""}],
